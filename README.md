Prices should be visible",Active
```

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:ai

# Run only high priority tests
npm run test:ai:high

# Run only medium priority tests
npm run test:ai:medium

# Run only low priority tests  
npm run test:ai:low
```

## 📝 How to Write Test Cases

### Test Case Format

Each test has 6 columns:

1. **Test ID**: Unique identifier (TC001, TC002...)
2. **Test Name**: Descriptive name
3. **Priority**: High, Medium, or Low
4. **Test Steps**: One step per line in plain English
5. **Expected Results**: What should happen (one per line)
6. **Status**: Active (will run) or Inactive (skipped)

### Example Test Steps

```
Navigate to https://example.com
Enter address 'Times Square, New York'
Set Enter After as 'tomorrow 8:00 PM'
Set Exit Before as 'tomorrow 11:00 PM'
Click search button
Wait for results to load
Click on first parking garage
Verify price is displayed
```

### Example Expected Results

```
Search results should be displayed
At least 5 parking options should be shown
Prices should be visible for each option
Map should show parking locations
URL should contain latitude and longitude
```

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Week 1: Basics
- Read `MANUAL_TESTER_GUIDE.md`
- Run existing test cases
- Modify one existing test case
- Create your first simple test

### Week 2: Expansion  
- Write 5-10 new test cases
- Cover different features
- Use different priorities
- Review test reports

### Week 3: Mastery
- Write 20+ test cases
- Organize tests by feature
- Create regression test suite
- Optimize test execution

### Month 2+: Scale
- Maintain 100+ test cases
- Run tests regularly
- Update tests as needed
- Train other team members

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run only high priority
npm run test:ai:high

# Run with custom filter (edit package.json)
npm run test:ai -- --filter "search"
```

### Test Organization

```
TC001-TC020: Search functionality
TC021-TC040: Booking flows  
TC041-TC060: User management
TC061-TC080: Payment processing
TC081-TC100: Admin features
```

## 📊 Sample Test Report

After running tests, you'll see:

```
====================================================
📊 Test Execution Summary
====================================================
Total Tests:  10
✅ Passed:     8
❌ Failed:     2
📈 Pass Rate:  80.0%
====================================================
```

Plus a beautiful HTML report with:
- Visual pass/fail summary
- Detailed test logs
- Screenshots for each step
- Error messages and stack traces
- Execution duration

## 🎯 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Write clear, specific test steps
- Use realistic test data
- Include verification steps
- Set appropriate priorities
- Mark obsolete tests as Inactive
- Review test reports regularly

### ❌ DON'T:
- Make steps too complex
- Skip expected results
- Leave vague descriptions
- Forget to update test cases
- Ignore failed tests

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Tests Not Running?
1. Check Node.js is installed: `node --version`
2. Run `npm install` again
3. Verify CSV file format is correct
4. Check test Status is "Active"

### Tests Failing?
1. Open `test-report.html` for details
2. Check screenshots in `screenshots/` folder
3. Verify website URL is accessible
4. Review test steps for clarity
5. Check if UI has changed

### AI Not Understanding Steps?
1. Make steps more specific
2. Use exact button/field names
3. Break complex steps into smaller ones
4. Check `MANUAL_TESTER_GUIDE.md` for examples

## 🚀 Scaling to 100+ Tests

### Strategy:

1. **Start Small** (Week 1)
   - 10-20 critical tests
   - High priority only
   - Core user journeys

2. **Expand** (Week 2-4)
   - Add 30-40 more tests
   - Cover all major features
   - Include medium priority

3. **Comprehensive** (Month 2)
   - Reach 80-100 tests
   - Add edge cases
   - Include low priority tests

4. **Maintain** (Ongoing)
   - Update as features change
   - Remove obsolete tests
   - Add tests for new features

### Organization Tips:

```csv
# Core Features (High Priority) - Run Daily
TC001-TC020: User authentication & search

# Secondary Features (Medium) - Run Weekly  
TC021-TC040: Booking and payments

# Edge Cases (Low) - Run Monthly
TC041-TC100: Error handling & special cases
```

## 📈 ROI & Benefits

### Time Savings:
- **Test Creation**: 5 minutes per test (vs 30-60 min coding)
